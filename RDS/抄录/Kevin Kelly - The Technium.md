- Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe.

- Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.
- Don't be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.
- Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them "Is there more?", until there is no more.

- Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.
